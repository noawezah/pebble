# PEBBLE

An English-first, Romanian-second specialty café site for PEBBLE, Bucharest. Next.js App Router, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, self-hosted Fraunces and DM Sans, Remix Icon, GSAP, and Sanity.

## Preview

- `/` — English café page
- `/ro` — Romanian café page
- `/design-system` — interactive visual system, in both languages
- `/studio` — Sanity Studio (requires a project)

Run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`. Use the exact URL printed by Next.js; port 3000 may be occupied. `npm run build` creates the Vercel-compatible production build. `npm run typecheck` checks TypeScript.

## Brand and content

Interface: off-white, charcoal and neutral greys only. Green is restricted to photographs. PEBBLE is always uppercase. The snail SVG is traced from the supplied original logo, not a newly invented symbol. Fraunces Black with SOFT 100 is the web-font alternative to Cooper Black; no commercial Cooper font is redistributed.

The reusable CSS tokens are in `app/globals.css`; the café composition is in `app/cafe.css`. Details and usage rules are in `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.

Confirmed local content is in `lib/content.ts`: Str. D. I. Mendeleev 10, 030167 București; weekdays 08:00–17:00; weekends 10:00–19:00. Menu/prices are intentionally absent until supplied. There are no fabricated reviews, ratings, awards, phone numbers or product prices.

## Sanity connection

The website works immediately using the confirmed local content. To activate CMS editing:

1. Create a Sanity project and a public `production` dataset in the owner's account.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`. These are project identifiers, not secret tokens.
3. Add the local and production Studio origins to Sanity's CORS settings with authenticated requests enabled.
4. Restart the dev server, visit `/studio`, and sign in with the project owner's Sanity account.
5. Open **Café content**. Fill both language fields and publish. The site reads published content and revalidates every 60 seconds. An empty menu is hidden. Invalid or missing fields use the local fallback.

The schema is in `sanity/schema.ts`. Studio authenticates through Sanity; no write token is embedded in the site. Sanity service connection cannot be verified until a real project is supplied. Initial copy remains local until entered and published in Studio.

## Vercel

This is a native Next.js app; `vercel.json` selects the Next.js framework. Import the repository into the owner's Vercel account, or run the Vercel CLI after signing in. Use `npm run build`, default Next.js output settings, and the same public Sanity settings. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` with the final HTTPS origin. No deployment account or remote project was supplied in this session, so no live deployment is claimed.

## Images

`public/images/` contains the supplied references, preserved generated PNG masters, and optimized WebP assets used by the site. AI-created or enhanced imagery is art direction based on the actual café references; small equipment and decorative details can differ. Original photographs and logos remain available. Generation provenance is recorded in `ASSETS.md`.

## Accessibility and motion

Real anchor navigation, Next.js language links, visible keyboard focus, descriptive image alternatives, semantic sections and hours, responsive 7-column desktop / 4-column mobile layouts. GSAP diagonal reveals run once; parallax does not hijack scrolling. `prefers-reduced-motion` disables scroll effects. Body text is at least 16px. No autoplay video or infinite animation.
